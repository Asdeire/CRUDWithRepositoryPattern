# CRUD With Repository Pattern

## Objective
The objective of this practical work is to learn how to use a multi-tier architecture through the Repository layer implemented using Hibernate.

## Overview
This practical work focuses on refactoring an existing Hibernate-based application to implement the Repository pattern. The Repository pattern is a crucial part of the data access layer in a multi-tier architecture. It abstracts the data access logic and provides a cleaner separation of concerns, making the code more maintainable and testable.

### Benefits of the Repository Pattern
1. **Separation of Concerns**: By abstracting the data access logic, the Repository pattern separates business logic from database interactions.
2. **Testability**: Repositories can be easily mocked or stubbed, facilitating unit testing of the business logic.
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized data access logic makes the codebase easier to manage and update.
4. **Reusability**: Common data access operations can be reused across different parts of the application.

By implementing the Repository pattern, developers can create a robust and scalable application architecture that is easier to maintain and extend.

## Tasks
1. **Create Repository Interfaces**: Define repository interfaces for each entity. These interfaces will declare the common data access methods.
2. **Implement Repository Classes**: Implement the repository interfaces using Hibernate. These classes will handle the actual database operations.
3. **Update Service Layer**: Refactor the service layer to use the repository classes instead of direct Hibernate interactions.
4. **Test the Application**: Ensure that the refactored application works correctly by running existing tests or writing new tests if necessary.
5. **Document the Changes**: Update the documentation to reflect the changes made during the refactoring process.

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Set up and configure your database.
- Run the application to execute CRUD operations through the Repository layer and observe the Hibernate-generated database schema.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions to the development of the Repository-based database processing system are welcome. Follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`.
3. Implement the changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Add new feature"`.
4. Push the changes to your fork: `git push origin feature/new-feature`.
5. Open a pull request for review and merging.
